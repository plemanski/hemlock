<h1> Welcome to the git repo for my small blog </h1>

In the fall of 2020, mid-worldwide pandemic, I decided it would be wise to quit my job and move to a small mountain town with expensive housing and limited job opportunities. This blog is all about my journey.

Being a computer science student that has delved into web development, I figured that a gatsby site hosted on netlify would be a good way to keep my skills sharp while I figure out my new life. 

This site might not be the best blog but I will be using it to showcase some of my web development abilities and to experiment with new tools.
